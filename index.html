It was made with a technique called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost-wax_casting'>Lost-wax casting</a>. It's the only way to obtain filigree and create complex figures, like the so-called Tunjos. And this was a change of paradigm. From building from hammering, to creating precise molds, molds that you could, eventually re-use. In general, you need to find new ways of doing stuff when the environment where you are doing it is totally new.</aside>

          value = reduce(+, j )

          end
      end
	    </code></pre>
	    <aside class='notes'>This is a Julia fragment. It does not work too well, and in fact it's slower than doing it sequentially. Why? Too little computation, too much communication. What's there is a "reduce" loop that adds up everything in the chromosome, but it's slower than using reduce directly in general, although you might get a slight improvement for big chromosome size with a single processor. If you use several processors there's going to be trouble no matter what. </aside>

	    <aside class='notes'>You may have realized tha tabove we use a list comprehension to deal with the paralellism; @distributed is a macro that applies to loops and might produce a result. We can't work on a loop whose body has a side effect, but on a loop that produces a result.</aside>

	    <aside class='notes'>This is Perl6, which is an amazing language, which we have already mentioned in the context of concurrent languages. It generally goes with functional languages (but not always), but in this case it is like that. Also reactive, as you can see from the chaining of different functions. We are using the "feed" or "rocket" operator in the first case, which is cool, and a reduce operator, which is simply [] around something.</aside>

<aside class='notes'>Evaluation can take anything, but it returns a Mix. It works internally with a MixHash, wich is a mutable version of same. Here's an interesting thing that I haven't seen in any other language; I'm using elements and its "weight" as score. This is going to be useful later on. Also, I'm using a cache so that I don't evaluate twice the same thing. It's not important at the beginning, but by the end of the simulation lots of values are going to be the same.</aside>
